Some more data science programs on Python.
You need to have both the python modules for data science implementation, numpy and pandas.
To install it you can either go to the terminal of your IDE or go to the command line prompt of your desktop and write these statements.                                         
>>>pip install numpy                                                                                                                                                              
>>>pip install pandas

There are certain c and cpp files also they include basic programs for graphs and DFS. The .exe files can be ignored as they are created in the run-time of the program.
